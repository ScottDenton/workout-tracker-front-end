The workout tracker allows users to securely login and record their workouts.

Including exercise name from a list of 200 exercises, weight used, number of reps and sets completed successfully and notes taken during workout.

On returning to an exercise you have previously logged, the app will provide a suggested weight and rep count based on the last time you did that exercise along with any notes you may have taken at the time.
note: they are only suggested weights and you should always follow safety guidelines for exercises and use a spotter when available

I am still actively working on this project and it is very much still a work in progress.
