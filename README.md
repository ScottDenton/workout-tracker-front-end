# Exercise Buddy
The workout tracker allows users to securely login and record their workouts.

Users can choose an exercise from a list of 200 exercises and input the weight used, number of reps and sets completed successfully and notes taken during a workout.

On returning to an exercise previously logged, the app will provide a suggested weight and rep count based on the last time a user did that exercise along with any notes they may have taken at the time.

For a demo of the app's main functionality visit [video](https://vimeo.com/334182434) or go to [Exercise Buddy](https://exercise-buddy.herokuapp.com/) and try it for yourself.

The backend for the project is stored in a separate repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/ScottDenton/workout-tracker-back-end).
