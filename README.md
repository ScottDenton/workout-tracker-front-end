# Workout Tracker
The workout tracker allows users to securely login and record their workouts.

Users can choose an exercise from a list of 200 exercises and input the weight used, number of reps and sets completed successfully and notes taken during a workout.

On returning to an exercise previously logged, the app will provide a suggested weight and rep count based on the last time a user did that exercise along with any notes they may have taken at the time.

I am still actively working on this but I have created a brief demo [video](https://vimeo.com/334182434) showcasing the app and will update this page when the app is officially online.

The backend for the project is stored in a separate repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/ScottDenton/workout-tracker-back-end).
