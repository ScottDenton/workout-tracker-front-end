#Workout Tracker
The workout tracker allows users to securely login and record their workouts.

Users can input an exercise name from a list of 200 exercises, weight used, number of reps and sets completed successfully and notes taken during workout.

On returning to an exercise you have previously logged, the app will provide a suggested weight and rep count based on the last time you did that exercise along with any notes you may have taken at the time.

I am still actively working on this but I have created a brief demo [video](https://vimeo.com/334182434) showcasing the app and will update this page when the app is officially online.

The backend for the project is store in a separate repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/ScottDenton/workout-tracker-back-end)
